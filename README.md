# Connected plotter

This is the backend to a little project about connecting my pen plotter to the internet. The axidraw library seemed to be more fully featured in python than the cli and because I only really know how to work in node.js I have a script that spawns a pretty lightweight python file to listen to calls from a js file and talk to my plotter

YAY for complexities. But what the code has in complexity, makes up for hopefully the speed in which I gain from developing it.
